<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Windows 10 in S mode is designed for security and performance, exclusively running apps from the Microsoft Store. If you want to install an app that isn’t available in the Microsoft Store, you’ll need to switch out of S mode. Switching out of S mode is one-way. If you make the switch, you won’t be able to go back to Windows 10 in S mode. There’s no charge to switch out of S mode.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">Windows 11 in S mode is only available in the Windows 11 Home edition.
